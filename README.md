# DSPipline_GroupF_BRFSS2020
Final Project for DS Pipeline using BRFSS data

#### Introduction:

Every year the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) sends out a series of questions to each of the states in the United States to record and measure the behavioral risk factors in the population aged 18 or older. This is a collaboration between the US states and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) which has been going on since 1984. BRFSS has been collecting data extensively on the preventive health practices,  risk behaviors linked to chronic diseases and other factors relating to habits and the access to health care across the US. 

The dataset being huge has a lot of scope in exploring the habits, health and lifestyle of the people in different states. 
As part of our project, we want to leverage this data to analyze and compare the health care access, habits and lifestyle choices and draw possible links to diseases such as the number of cases of Cancer in the country, the Asthma rate and cases of Diabetes.

Our goal is to compare the statewide data and see how the simple choices and access to health care facilities are connected to the disease rates in a state. This can also help us to come up with answers on which states are prone to more cases and why? What is the demographic that is mostly being affected and do lifestyle choices make a difference.
